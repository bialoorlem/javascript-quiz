# javascript-quiz
This is a quiz that the user will need to use to test their javascript knowledge

The purpose of this quiz is to test my abilities with Javascript in the forms of a timer, dynamic HTML, and local storage

I used a lot of inspiration from class activities and videos. I also searched on the web and found resources on Youtube and other sources.

One of the main sources of information I referred to was Code Explained on Youtube. The main video I referenced is found here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU
