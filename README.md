This is a quiz that the user will need to use to test their javascript knowledge

The purpose of this quiz is to test my abilities with Javascript in the forms of a timer, dynamic HTML, and local storage

I used a lot of inspiration from class activities and videos. I also searched on the web and found resources on Youtube and other sources.

One of the main sources of information I referred to was Code Explained on Youtube. The main video I referenced is found here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU

To start the quiz, the player is introduced to a single button labeled, "Let's Get Started!"

Once the player clicks the button, the game and timer begins.

In this quiz, the player must answer the questions correctly before time runs out.

If the player answers correctly, an alert appears to let them know and the game continues.

If the player answers incorrectly, an alert appears to let them know and the timer subtracts ten seconds from the running game clock.

The game appears as follows:

![Alt text](/relative/path/to/screenshot1?raw=true "1")

![Alt text](/relative/path/to/screenshot1?raw=true "2")

![Alt text](/relative/path/to/screenshot1?raw=true "3")
